# medium-followers-count
Fetch your followers count as well as your clap count from MEDIUM


This sample code scraps your profile page in MEDIUM and pulls out your followers count and if you use other function and pass your post url it will pull out the clap count since MEDIUM doens't provide a REST API to do the same.


## NOTE

IN CLAP COUNT API I WAS GETTING CORS ERROR AND DIDN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THE WORK AROUND TO THIS BUT IF YOU  FIND ONE FEEL FREE TO RAISE A PR.
